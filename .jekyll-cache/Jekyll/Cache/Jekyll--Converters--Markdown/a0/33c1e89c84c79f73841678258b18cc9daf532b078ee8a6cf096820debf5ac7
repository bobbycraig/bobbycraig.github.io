I"\<p>As a developer at Mailchimp (we’re hiring 😉), I often find myself on the receiving end of lighthearted “code monkey” jokes from friends in the industry. While these comments are usually made in jest, they do touch on a stereotype that, for many, still persists about the role of developers. The idea that a “code monkey” is simply someone who churns out code without much thought or creativity has been around for a while. But in my experience, nothing could be further from the truth—at least not at Mailchimp, where we place a high value on communication, innovation, and growth.</p>
