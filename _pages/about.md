I was born on a haunting Friday evening. The air was crisp and the Cleveland Indians were in the bottom of the 8th of what would turn out to be an 11-inning game for the AL title. My mom says I looked handsome that evening...but she still says that, so she's not exactly reliable.

I spent my youth convincing my little sister that she was a Power Ranger, shoveling mulch with my dad, and eventually opening a bike-repair shop with one of my neighborhood best friends (I don't think we ever had a single customer).

As I grew older I branched out a bit. I [spoke to walls](http://lswhawk.com/arts/talking-to-walls-a-little-bit-about-speech-and-debate/) occassionaly, became the [president of a university](https://craiguniversity.github.io/) (it's not a big deal...okay, maybe it is), became a well-known ice cream critic, and graduated high school somewhere along the way. Time flies.

I attended [Denison University](https://denison.edu) and eventually decided it would be best if I got a job because spending money on my education was putting me in quite a bit of debt.

Today, I still do things. Some of them&mdash;flying, hiking, traveling, riding motorcycles, running&mdash;are considered constructive. Some of them&mdash;watching Star Wars, reading Wikipedia articles about serial killers, eating excessively sugary foods&mdash;are not. I **even** do some things professionally (insert applause here)...

I'm currently working at [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) as a Software Engineer, and I'm _always_ looking for opportunities to teach, volunteer, learn, break things, or...well, I guess fix things too?
