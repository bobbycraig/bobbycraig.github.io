When Intuit acquired Mailchimp for $12 billion in 2021[^1], I found myself asking a question I hadn't revisited since college: how many pieces of a ship can you replace before it's no longer the same ship? The thought experiment, the Ship of Theseus, first intrigued me when I role-played as the fictional Lithicles of Scambonidae, a master stonemason turned aspiring tyrant, in an Ancient Greece simulation. Back then, I wielded it as rhetorical flair to justify rebuilding Athens' walls (and yes, I made _"Build the Wall" jokes_ at the time ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Decades later, the metaphor took on new weight as I watched my workplace transform under Intuit's stewardship.

To set the stage, here's a refresher on the Ship of Theseus. Imagine a ship docked for decades. Over time, its planks rot and are replaced, one by one, until none of the original wood remains. Philosophers then ask: is it still the Ship of Theseus? Or has it become something entirely different? The experiment probes identity‚Äîof objects, people, and, as I've come to appreciate, companies.

### A Bootstrapped Ship

Mailchimp was, in many ways, a marvel of bootstrap engineering. Founded in 2001, it grew organically from a scrappy email marketing tool into a powerhouse of small-business software. When I joined the team in 2017, the spirit of independence permeated everything. We didn't have a board of directors or investors to please; decisions were made with a focus on what worked for our customers. Teams were lean, autonomy was high, hierarchies flat, and creative experiments encouraged. It was a quirky, irreverent, and sometimes chaotic ship, but it was ours.

Then came the acquisition. Intuit‚Äîthe maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks, and other financial software staples‚Äîis a behemoth with a market cap north of $150 billion. Overnight, our quirky startup became part of Corporate America. The shift felt seismic. Suddenly, there were new systems, new leadership, and new priorities. Some colleagues questioned: Is this still Mailchimp? Or is it just another cog in Intuit's machine?

### The Planks Begin to Shift

The immediate changes were logistical. Payroll and HR moved to Intuit's system. A year later, we slowly started to adopt their tech stack and compliance processes.¬† Soon thereafter, cultural shifts started to emerge. And... of course... the layoff[^2]. Mailchimp's offbeat humor was tempered to align with Intuit's more buttoned-up brand. Decisions that once took hours now required weeks of cross-departmental approvals. Teams expanded‚Äîa welcome relief in some cases, but also a harbinger of bureaucracy.

Yet these changes weren't inherently bad. Intuit's resources brought stability and perks we could only dream of as an independent company. There was funding for ambitious projects and a more mature technical foundation, better benefits, and access to world-class talent. The "ship" was sturdier than ever, even if its design felt unfamiliar.

Here's where the Ship of Theseus metaphor starts to creak under the weight of complexity. Unlike a static ship, companies aren't inert objects; they're dynamic organisms shaped by the people who inhabit them. The Mailchimp I joined in 2017 was already different from the Mailchimp of 2010... and the Mailchimp of 2020. In the years leading up to the acquisition, we'd launched a marketing CRM, a website builder, and were (for some reason) sending postcards[^3]‚Äîtransformations as significant as replacing a hull or sail. The question, then, isn't just about what changes, but who decides what the ship's purpose should be.

As Lithicles might have argued in Athens, rebuilding isn't inherently bad‚Äîunless you're the one plotting to overthrow the government while rebuilding the city's walls. For Mailchimp, the "rebuild" under Intuit raised similar stakes. Could we retain our commitment to small businesses while navigating Intuit's vast ecosystem? Or would we, like Athens, find ourselves subsumed by forces larger than we anticipated? The stakes may not have involved democracy or tyrants, but they certainly felt monumental in their own way.

### The Crew's Perspective

One of the more illuminating outcomes of the acquisition has been watching how my colleagues have responded. Some, thrilled by the opportunities Intuit offers, leaned into the change, seeing it as a natural evolution of Mailchimp's mission. Others mourned the loss of autonomy and left for scrappier ventures. Many, like me, found themselves somewhere in the middle: nostalgic for the past and curious about the future.

A recurring theme in these discussions has been the importance of values. Mailchimp's identity was never about its tools alone; it was about empowering small businesses with empathy and delight. Intuit's slogan, "Powering prosperity around the world," resonates with this ethos, but the scale is different. Where Mailchimp's founders could personally champion a vision, Intuit's vision must be implemented across 17,000 employees. The "ship" is bigger, but are we all rowing in the same direction?

### Navigating the Paradox

The Ship of Theseus teaches us that identity is both continuity and change. The Mailchimp I'm part of today is undeniably different from the one I joined. But it's also a testament to resilience. Like Athens rebuilding its walls, we've adapted to new realities while trying to preserve our core.

It's tempting to declare the "ship" irrevocably altered‚Äîto say that Intuit's acquisition ended Mailchimp's independent spirit. But identity doesn't have to be binary. Perhaps the real lesson is that the ship's journey matters more than its components. Mailchimp's spirit wasn't in its policies or logos; it was in its people and their shared mission. And as long as those people continue to build with purpose, the ship sails on.

### Reflections...

Reflecting on this, I'm reminded of my game as Lithicles. Athens' walls were rebuilt (and yes, Lithicles won the lucrative contract), but my ambitions didn't stop there. I tried to overthrow the government‚Äîbecause why stop at masonry when you can aim for tyranny? The Athenians, bless their democratic hearts, tried to ostracize me and narrowly failed. Democracy crumbled soon after, replaced by a dictator who wasn't me. So much for civic resilience, but hey, at least the walls looked great. But I digress...

So, is Mailchimp still the same ship? Maybe the better question is: What do we, as the crew, want it to become? For now, I'm still aboard, steering where I can, and watching the horizon with  optimism.

The Ship of Theseus might never answer whether the planks make the ship. But it reminds us to ask: What's worth preserving, and what's worth rebuilding‚Äîin fictional Athens and in  software.
