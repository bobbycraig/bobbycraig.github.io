<p>I feel this is better watched than explained. The first semester of my college experience I took a course with Brenda Boyle called "The Languages of War". This class was one of my favorites at Denison. We discussed war narratives and how patriotism is framed to call us to war and war is an act humans engage in simply to give ourselves meaning. The RIDICULOUS amounts of death that occurred in WWII should be avoided at all costs in the future. No issue should be so pressing to lose millions of lives in armed conflict. This video is humbling and thought-provoking.</p>
