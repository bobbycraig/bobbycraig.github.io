<p>I never needed anything to solidify the fact that I'm a nerd, but if I did this would be it. I found ridiculous amounts of joy in listening to Mufasa tell Simba about C++ as The Circle of Life majestically plays in the background. "All the code you write exists in a delicate balance. As a programmer, you need to respect that balance." The life lessons from The Lion King seem to extend far beyond that of the actual movie.</p>
