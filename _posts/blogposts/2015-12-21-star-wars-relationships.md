<p>I thought this was a really cool data science project. In light of all of the Star Wars hype, here are all of the relationships between ALL characters analyzed in the first six movies. Evelina Gabasova did a great job. The creator first had to parse all of the scripts and get them into the correct format (which is ridiculously annoying), and then they used R to run statistical analysis and JavaScript to visually represent it. The end result is freaking cool and interesting to read about. I knew Obi-Wan was the best the whole time. I hope to do something like this in the future.</p>
