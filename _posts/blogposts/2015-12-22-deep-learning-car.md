<p>Really interesting perspective on how to get a self-driving car to work. Instead of teaching it how to drive, let it teach itself by watching you. While I'm not a fan of George Hotz's attitude, I think he's absolutely brilliant and this could be a great approach to a problem companies have been trying to tackle for a while.</p>
