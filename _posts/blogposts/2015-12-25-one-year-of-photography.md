<p>A year ago today I took my first picture with my Canon T5...an ambitious beginning to photography. The picture above is one of the first photos I took with my camera. Pictured is a neighborhood stray cat named "Tiddle" that my family allows to live in our garage (now our breezeway too!). I've learned a great deal in my one year as an amateur photographer. Photography is a great creative outlet, and I have actually made it constructive by earning a few awards in my county fair! I hope to continue on with my newest hobby for years to come&mdash;I'm not the best so it's great to see my progress as time goes on.</p>
