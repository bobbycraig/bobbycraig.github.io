<p>Quick little update here...since as long as I can remember my family has watched one movie <strong>EVERY</strong> Christmas: The Best Christmas Ever. This wonderful Wee-Sing movie has tons of catchy songs, elves that have names that are too similar to drugs, and so much 90s clothing that it makes me sick. I don't consider myself a very Christmas-y person&mdash;it's definitely not my favorite holiday (especially with all of the commercialization). However, this movie brings out all of the great parts and that little tap of nostalgia that makes me feel like a boy again. I would really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Christmas classic. It's bound to become one of your favorites!</p>
