<p>So, he doesn't know I'm doing this, and I probably won't tell him, but I've read his posts and I think other people need to as well. There's this new "Buzzfeed-esque" blogging platform floating around called "Odyssey". I kind of hate it because it's all that shows up on my social media anymore, but I love reading some really insightful people's thoughts (and hate poorly written trash posts...so there's that). One of my favorite posts are by my good friend, Ryan Erickson. Ryan writes about a multitude of subject-areas and his articles always keep me entertained. So, if by some chance you're reading my blog and not his (which would be weird because I don't advertise mine or anything...), I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU READ HIS ARTICLES.</p>
