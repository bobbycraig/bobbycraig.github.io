<p>Well, I finished v0.1.1 of my first Chrome extension. Called Congresstributions (sort of a bastardization of Congress and Contributions if you didn't catch that), this extension adds a Congressperson's largest contributor after their name on any webpage. My next step is to make this prettier because I'm all about design, but right now I'm pretty happy with its primitive version for the time being. I'd highly suggest downloading it if you're into politics at all.</p>
<p>COMPLETELY UNRELATED, I'm leaving to go on a road trip tonight with friends from high school, so there's a good chance I won't post anything for a week or so. After that I'll be interning with <a href="//codemash.org">CodeMash</a>, so again, I probably won't be super present. But the week after I'll be home alone for a week (almost all universities go back a week earlier than mine), so I'll be up to no good working on projects then!</p>
