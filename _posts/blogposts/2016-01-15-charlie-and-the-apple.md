Heh. Hehe. I'd say I try to use iOS and Android devices pretty equally and MacOS and Windows devices pretty equally. I try to stay platform agnostic, but I have to say...I think this is absolutely hilarious. Collegehumor does some videos really well. Apple's treasure may be in its marketing...but I love my rMBP. Is it worth the price? Maybe. Either way, I like it! Enjoy this little satirical video.
