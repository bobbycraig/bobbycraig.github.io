Well, I'm back to school and am already feeling the pressure this semester. It should be fun, but I think it'll also be slightly challenging (as it is being a CS major). I'm working on a few side projects, and I'm trying to figure out how to integrate the Google Calendar API into a website for Denison Enterprises....this is proving to be difficult because the way they need to use it isn't supported and it's all wanky. I'm also working on study abroad stuff, and I'm hoping to go to either South Africa, Hungary, or Germany. We shall see what happens next!
