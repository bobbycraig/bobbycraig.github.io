I've never read the story...I was never too interested in reading the story. However, I saw Pride and Prejudice preformed by the <a href="http://avltheatre.com">Available Light Theater</a> on Saturday and it was absolutely wonderful. It was sort of slow at the beginning (and kind of hard to follow since there were 5 people playing all of the characters and lots of asides), but once I caught on, I loved it! I don't go to enough theatre performances, and I really should look into it more...especially since my roommate is a theatre major...oops!
