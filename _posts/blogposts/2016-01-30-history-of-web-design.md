As my Github repos suggest, I've been getting pretty involved with web design. I find it fascinating how easy it is to create something and instantly share it with anyone around the world. Anyway, I found this nifty blog depicting the history of web design and thought I'd link it for my future reference and anyone who happens to stumble upon this. <strong>ALSO</strong>, update on my DenEn project. So, I'm making a catering calendar and was going to try to integrate Google Calendars because I didn't think I had a choice. It turns out, I can do it a different way and am super excited to do so. More on that at some point, I'm sure.
