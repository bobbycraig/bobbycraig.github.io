You may notice that a little further down I have a video on typography. The other night, I fangirled about <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/pacioli/regular/">Pacioli</a>, this really sexy font, to a good friend of mine. While I'm by no means a typography expert, I consider it one of my hobbies. I take Coursera courses on it, watch YouTube videos on it, and, as you can see from the article linked above, enjoy reading about the psychology of it. The power that typography has on people is astounding...it can make something be taken more seriously or, in some cases (Comic Sans), make whatever you're writing turn to garbage. While I'm not going to rant and rave about typography and typefaces much more, if you enjoy any sort of design work I highly suggest the linked article!
