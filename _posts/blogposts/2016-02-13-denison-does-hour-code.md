Several weeks ago, Denison's computer science (and math) department decided to host an <a href="https://code.org">Hour of Code</a> for any faculty, Granville residents, or students wanting to implement code into their repertoire of skills. I was lucky enough to be able to help out! I love Hour of Code events and have volunteered with quite a few of them even helping one teacher in a nearby school prep activities for her Hour of Code. All the while, I've been planning an event at my high school...hopefully soon! I'm really passionate about CompSci education and helping it become as much of a necessity in our schooling as math, history, and English. I'm really salty about the fact that my high school didn't offer any CompSci courses or informal ways to learn. Back in the day a teacher taught AP CS, but I apparently missed that by 15 years. I'm super excited about the prospect of sharing my passion and sparking some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SqTR0DorSw">youngling's</a> interests.
