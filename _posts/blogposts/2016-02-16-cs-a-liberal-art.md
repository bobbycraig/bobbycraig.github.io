I'm a Computer Science major at a liberal arts school...not always the most highly sought after combinations––and I don't know why that is! After a cursory look at the linked article and a little time spent at any liberal arts school, you'll learn just how valuable a liberal arts degree is. Sure, maybe my education isn't as "in depth" as a technical school, but I have the opportunity of self-exploration in the area AND I become a well-rounded, critical thinker. I love Denison and all that the education has done for me. It's given me incredible tools to shape my future...and it's DEFINITELY a positive, not a negative.
