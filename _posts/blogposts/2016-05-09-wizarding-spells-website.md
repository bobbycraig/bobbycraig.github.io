I've not written on this blog in a <strong>long</strong> time. However, now exams are over and I'm back to espouse more wizzydum. I saw this article on Reddit and thought it was interesting...not necessarily a great article, but it combines two things I love––Harry Potter and web stuff. Read along and anticipate some more posts in the near future!
