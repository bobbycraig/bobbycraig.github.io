I'm currently trying to write a webapp. I've done a few projects before but nothing of the magnitude I'm planning for this one. That said, it's really tough keeping all of my thoughts and decisions organized, and I'm looking for ways to do that best. While looking, I stumbled upon this website. While it's not entirely comprehensive, it does give some great tips... and it's really easy to read. Building a website?
