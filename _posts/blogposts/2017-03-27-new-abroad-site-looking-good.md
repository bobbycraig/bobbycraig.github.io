I'm working on a new abroad site because the traditional blog won't work for me. I've had fun abroad and I want a project that matches my enjoyment. Therefore, inspired by <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/12/16/animated-map-path-for-interactive-storytelling/">this</a>, I decided to create an animated map to truly tell the story of my travels. The project isn't nearly as easy as I thought it would be, but I'm honing my JS skills and having a good time.

You can click the link below to check out what I have so far... it's pretty nifty even in its raw form. Just scroll down slowly (and ignore the lorem ipsum stuff...no real text yet) to see the traveling fun!
