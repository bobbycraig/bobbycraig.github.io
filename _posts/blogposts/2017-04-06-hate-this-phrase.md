Ok, so, this might come off as a little bit "ranty", but I have a confession...I hate it when people utter (or type) the sentence:

<blockquote>&ldquo;Wow, you have too much time on your hands.&rdquo;</blockquote>

Ugh. UGH! Usually I hear this from people after telling them about a hobby or after reading a book or after creating something that took me a lot of time and energy. The worst is that the people who say this often spend their time on Facebook 24/7, getting drunk every night of the week, or engaging is as much gossip and drama as possible...people who feel uncomfortable for consuming but not contributing creatively to the world often have that to say to creators. And it drives me nuts, although I know I should probably take it as a compliment. I don't know. Just a slight rant.
