Here at Jacobs, boredom does interesting things to me. One of those things happens to be that it makes me think of the future&mdash;specifically, my time at Denison. I'm rooming with Oliver next year and figured I'd give a try at creating our room layout (of course nowhere near what it'll actually be since we're poor college students). But yeah, I took the floor plan from MyDenison and guessed on dimensions and ended up with the result below. Beware, it's processor heavy.
