In a (probably) impulsive fashion, I decided to delete practically all of my social media (I kept Facebook because I need it for groups). This means that I deleted Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and anything else I deemed necessary. I did this for several reasons.

<ol>
  <li>It's distracting. Although I still spend way too much time on Reddit and Facebook, I'm not mindlessly scrolling through Instagram feeds or watching Snapchat stories anymore.</li>
  <li>Social media is depressing. It allows you to focus on others' lives instead of focusing on your own. With social media, everyone posts their highlights and most people tend to compare that to their day-to-day. Blech.</li>
  <li>I really don't actually enjoy social media that much.</li>
</ol>

So yeah, I got rid of it and am pretty happy. There have been some instances where I had an urge to snap someone something or post a sentimental Instagram post, but I have refrained thus far! Woo! I'll probably use this blog to post some stuff instead to cope...idk. We shall see.
