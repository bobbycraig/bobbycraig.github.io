I have officially moved into Atlanta. I'm interning with MailChimp this summer, and I'm super excited to get started. The weather is rather warm and humid here, but I'm sure it won't take me too long to get adjusted. I can't wait to meet the other interns&mdash;my roommate Garrett seems to be a pretty swell guy, and I'm sure we'll get along well this summer. It's definitely nice not being in a row house with 5 other guys again!

Here's to a great summer!
