So, it's not entirely official, but I've sent out the link to a few people for my abroad blog. I've mostly finished the writing (aside from some editing because I'm a bit too lazy to read my own writing...it takes a long while) and the design is mostly done. I'm trying to think of ways to reduce the page loading size & time (it's like 30MB with pictures and everything) and the SVG stuff destroys processors so I need to figure that out. But...efficiency aside and editing aside...I'm done! Woo!

I'm pretty happy with the result and once I figure out those efficiency kinks (or if I do, I suppose), I will make a "how I built this" guide because those are useful and fun.
