It's Wednesday. I've been in Atlanta for four days, and I'm absolutely loving my time here. MailChimp is a really great company&mdash;I'm really missing my co-workers from Tenable though... I'm hoping to make relationships at MailChimp like I made at Tenable. I came in a little later than most of the other interns, so I feel like I'm kind of on the outside looking in for a lot of stuff, but I'm doing my best to integrate myself into the group.

I made my first trip to the grocery store. I've been walking everywhere...I actually haven't turned my car on since getting here (I need to remember to do that occasionally). Trader Joe's is really expensive and I didn't know that before going. However, the smoothie I produced after arriving was wonderful. So yeah, not terrible I guess.

Also, important to note: still no broads despite being in Atlanta.
