I suppose you could say it's been a pretty good week (aside from the Cavs losing the finals...pfft). I've gotten to know the other interns at MailChimp much better, I have been getting into a rhythm and living a decently healthy lifestyle, and I even won a scavenger hunt (and therefore a Freddie) from MailChimp!
