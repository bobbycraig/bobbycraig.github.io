I decided to go running in Piedmont Park near my apartment today, and I was welcomed with a wonderful surprise. I entered the park and made my way through one of the winding paths when I happened upon hundreds of people and a large concert stage set up. I was curious so I stumbled that way...and the crowd and performance was enough to get me to stay. Despite the hundreds of mosquito bites I must have endured, I sat through an hour of the concert and thoroughly enjoyed myself. There was great energy, the set list was diverse and exciting, and it was nice to just get outside and chill.

I'm definitely really liking Atlanta. Just when I think there's a lot to do, I'm surprised to find out that there's even more than I originally thought.
