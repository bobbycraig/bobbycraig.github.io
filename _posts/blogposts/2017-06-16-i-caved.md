It didn't take me too long of being in a city alone to finally cave and recreate my Instagram. I'm still going strong without Snapchat, but Instagram is a killer. Better yet, my account actually got deleted so I have to start over from scratch. This'll be...interesting. However, while I <em>did</em> make my account, I'm still not sure whether or not I'll simply use it to creep...or if I'll actually feel compelled enough to actually post stuff.

We shall see...
