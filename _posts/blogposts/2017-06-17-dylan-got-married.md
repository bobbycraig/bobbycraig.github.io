Quick update: during the spring my friend Dylan notified me that he was getting married and invited me to attend his wedding. I knew I'd be in Atlanta for the summer and his wedding was in Pennsylvania, so it'd be tough, but eventually I made it work with plane tickets and whatnot. It was convenient that it was the same weekend as Father's Day...I knocked out two birds with one stone. Anyway, I flew into PA, got to see Dylan and lots of Denison people, had a ton of fun, enjoyed the wedding, and danced the night away. Good times.
