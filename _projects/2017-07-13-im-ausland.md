Since [the project itself](https://bobbylcraig.com/im-ausland/) is a blog, I don't feel that I need to do too extensive of a write-up on it. However, I think it should be said that this is one of my favorite projects I've ever completed. _Im Ausland_ gave me the opportunity to combine my love of technology, travel, and a deep interest in writing (which I'm working on...) all in to one project.

After I completed the project I also created a [how-to thingamajig](https://medium.com/@bobbylcraig/interactive-map-blog-study-abroad-project-ef87e3e938fb) to show other people how to do what I did...this really solidifies my lack of need to do a write-up. So yeah, cool project. Lots of fun. Go travel.
