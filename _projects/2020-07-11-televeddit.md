Televeddit is a site I hacked together in a day (expect resultant code quality). I ran into an issue where I'd be watching a TV show years after all my friends had finished it (first with Mad Men in Fall of 2019), I'd hop onto the subreddit, and I couldn't participate because of all the spoilers. My friends didn't want to talk about the shows, or couldn't without divulging secrets, so I decided to see what Reddit had to say when they were in my position (with no future knowledge).

Light and simple, I think it's a good solution to a (perhaps unique?) problem.

Note: this probably won't be super useful for streaming services where whole seasons are released at the same time. Unless you only view the last episode of each season.
