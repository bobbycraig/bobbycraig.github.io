Buzzard Budgeting is a budgeting platform built specifically for Denison University's budgeting needs. Being part of Denison's finance committee, I built the tool to help streamline the budgeting process. While I've dealt with React before, it was usually on a very small scale&mdash;this was my first interaction with large-scale React and the inclusion of Redux.
