<p>Since <a href="https://bobbylcraig.com/im-ausland/">the project itself</a> is a blog, I don’t feel that I need to do too extensive of a write-up on it. However, I think it should be said that this is one of my favorite projects I’ve ever completed. <em>Im Ausland</em> gave me the opportunity to combine my love of technology, travel, and a deep interest in writing (which I’m working on…) all in to one project.</p>

<p>After I completed the project I also created a <a href="https://medium.com/@bobbylcraig/interactive-map-blog-study-abroad-project-ef87e3e938fb">how-to thingamajig</a> to show other people how to do what I did…this really solidifies my lack of need to do a write-up. So yeah, cool project. Lots of fun. Go travel.</p>
