    <h3>Wizarding Spells: Like Websites? <small>May 9, 2016</small></h3>
    <a href="http://blog5366.com/05-05-2016/harry-potter-spells-are-like-wesbites/"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/HarryPotterWebDesign.png"></a>
    <p>I've not written on this blog in a <strong>long</strong> time. However, now exams are over and I'm back to espouse more wizzydum. I saw this article on Reddit and thought it was interesting...not necessarily a great article, but it combines two things I love––Harry Potter and web stuff. Read along and anticipate some more posts in the near future!</p>

    <h3>Computer Science: A Liberal Art <small>February 16, 2016</small></h3>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science major at a liberal arts school...not always the most highly sought after combinations––and I don't know why that is! After a cursory look at the linked article and a little time spent at any liberal arts school, you'll learn just how valuable a liberal arts degree is. Sure, maybe my education isn't as "in depth" as a technical school, but I have the opportunity of self-exploration in the area AND I become a well-rounded, critical thinker. I love Denison and all that the education has done for me. It's given me incredible tools to shape my future...and it's DEFINITELY a positive, not a negative.</p>

    <h3>Denison Does An Hour Of Code <small>February 13, 2016</small></h3>
    <a href="https://news.denison.edu/2016/02/curtis-codebreakers/"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/HourOfCode.jpeg"></a>
    <p>Several weeks ago, Denison's computer science (and math) department decided to host an <a href="https://code.org">Hour of Code</a> for any faculty, Granville residents, or students wanting to implement code into their repertoire of skills. I was lucky enough to be able to help out! I love Hour of Code events and have volunteered with quite a few of them even helping one teacher in a nearby school prep activities for her Hour of Code. All the while, I've been planning an event at my high school...hopefully soon! I'm really passionate about CompSci education and helping it become as much of a necessity in our schooling as math, history, and English. I'm really salty about the fact that my high school didn't offer any CompSci courses or informal ways to learn. Back in the day a teacher taught AP CS, but I apparently missed that by 15 years. I'm super excited about the prospect of sharing my passion and sparking some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SqTR0DorSw">youngling's</a> interests.</p>

    <a href="http://www.companyfolders.com/blog/font-psychology-how-typefaces-hack-our-brains"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/Typography.jpg"></a>
    <p>You may notice that a little further down I have a video on typography. The other night, I fangirled about <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/pacioli/regular/">Pacioli</a>, this really sexy font, to a good friend of mine. While I'm by no means a typography expert, I consider it one of my hobbies. I take Coursera courses on it, watch YouTube videos on it, and, as you can see from the article linked above, enjoy reading about the psychology of it. The power that typography has on people is astounding...it can make something be taken more seriously or, in some cases (Comic Sans), make whatever you're writing turn to garbage. While I'm not going to rant and rave about typography and typefaces much more, if you enjoy any sort of design work I highly suggest the linked article!</p>

    <p>As my Github repos suggest, I've been getting pretty involved with web design. I find it fascinating how easy it is to create something and instantly share it with anyone around the world. Anyway, I found this nifty blog depicting the history of web design and thought I'd link it for my future reference and anyone who happens to stumble upon this. <strong>ALSO</strong>, update on my DenEn project. So, I'm making a catering calendar and was going to try to integrate Google Calendars because I didn't think I had a choice. It turns out, I can do it a different way and am super excited to do so. More on that at some point, I'm sure.</p>

    <p>I've never read the story...I was never too interested in reading the story. However, I saw Pride and Prejudice preformed by the <a href="http://avltheatre.com">Available Light Theater</a> on Saturday and it was absolutely wonderful. It was sort of slow at the beginning (and kind of hard to follow since there were 5 people playing all of the characters and lots of asides), but once I caught on, I loved it! I don't go to enough theatre performances, and I really should look into it more...especially since my roommate is a theatre major...oops!</p>

    <p>Well, I'm back to school and am already feeling the pressure this semester. It should be fun, but I think it'll also be slightly challenging (as it is being a CS major). I'm working on a few side projects, and I'm trying to figure out how to integrate the Google Calendar API into a website for Denison Enterprises....this is proving to be difficult because the way they need to use it isn't supported and it's all wanky. I'm also working on study abroad stuff, and I'm hoping to go to either South Africa, Hungary, or Germany. We shall see what happens next!</p>

    <h3>CodeMash 2016 <small>January 9, 2016</small></h3>
    <a href="http://codemash.org"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/CodeMash2016.jpg"></a>
    <p>I had <em>so</em> much fun this week. For the past few days I have been interning at CodeMash, a tech conference in Sandusky, Ohio. In my short 4 days, I learned a <strong>ton</strong> of new things, met some really great people, and had a metric shitton of fun. It was great. The first day I got there I had no idea what to expect. I came into a room full of people talking about web frameworks and unit testing...it was intimidating! But we quickly warmed up to each other and I made some great friends. The first session I had to proctor was exceptionally exciting. I walked in and introduced myself to the speaker. By some bizarre coincidence, THE SPEAKER WENT TO DENISON! Since I have maybe 15 people in my graduating class that are CS majors, this was highly unlikely. Turns out he works at Microsoft now and is doing really awesome things with big data.</p>
    <p>Later, I found out there was even more coincidence. Two of the best people I met at the conference were both from the Newark, Ohio area (which is right beside Denison, if you're not familiar with Ohio geography). They let me in on a really great developer group they started in Newark, and I'm hoping to attend some of those meetups whenever I get a car!</p>
    <p>In the end, I met a ton of companies that I'd love to work for some day. I was hoping to narrow down my interests when coming to CodeMash...but it had the opposite effect. There's so much interesting work out there that needs to be done and I'M SUPPOSED TO PICK ONE THING I WANT TO DO?!?! That's like picking a career field all over again... Either way, in the end I know I'll love doing whatever I end up doing. And I know I'll be surrounded by some pretty great people.</p>

    <h3>Winter Road Trip 2016 <small>January 3, 2016</small></h3>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="images/RoadTrip2016.jpg">
    <p>I'm not sure if I'm quite sure how to reflect on this year's trip yet...I haven't slept much and drove the last 5 hours last night which was draining. However, I'll attempt because it's still pretty fresh in my mind.</p>
    <p>My friends (Tristan, Joseph, and Adam) and I left on Tuesday night to embark on a grandiose journey! We had decided we wanted to visit New Orleans, but we hadn't decided definitively all of the different cities we would stop in. Despite our indecision, we left in our minivan and headed for New Orleans. On the way, we decided we should first stop in <strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>. We arrived in Louisville at 3:00am, so we didn't get to see a ton of things (namely, people that were awake). We walked around and stopped at the Louisville Slugger Museum and factory downtown. We also checked out all of the beautiful decorations they had out and the amazing view of the Ohio River. However, because it was 3:00am we left without doing much. We DID pass the Churchill Downs, which I thought was pretty cool. Our next stop was <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>. Nashville, in my opinion, was the biggest letdown of the entire trip. We parked on Vanderbilt's campus at ~6:00am, and we decided to grab some breakfast. It was pretty good (shoutout to the <a href="http://www.thepancakepantry.com">Pancake Pantry</a>). After breakfast, on minimal sleep, we headed into town&mdash;they were setting up for a New Year's Eve concert, so it was pretty busy at 8:00am (or whenever we arrived). We immediately started looking for little shops to stop in...but there were very few. Those that were there were closed for New Years or didn't open until later. So, we loitered a little and grabbed a little bit to eat. Ultimately, we got bored and went back to the car to sleep (yes, we all slept in the car the whole week). After our little nap, we made our way to <strong>New Orleans, Louisiana</strong>.</p>
    <p>New Orleans was incredible. We were there for New Year's, so it was a little crazy, but I thought it was the best location of the trip. There was tons to do in New Orleans (and we aren't even 21). There were shops galore, plenty of people to talk to, and architecture in the French Quarter to admire. It was a lovely destination. Furthermore, all sorts of interesting things happened to us in New Orleans. A random <em>blazed</em> fellow told my friend that he looked like he had AIDS...that was interesting. We had a waiter who told us his name...probably 8 times in one sitting. My friend also probably had 10 New Year's kisses...but maybe that's just him. We counted down the New Year and made our way to <strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong> the next day.</p>
    <p>Atlanta was fun, but not nearly as much fun as New Orleans. We spent a day there but then decided we should head home. So, after 10 hours of driving, numerous bathroom/food stops, and plenty of replays of "Come on Eileen" and "500 Miles", I am home and drinking coffee. Great trip. Great memories. Awesome friends. Can't wait until next year!</p>

    <h3>Who Are They <em>REALLY</em> Representing? <small>December 30, 2015</small></h3>

    <p>Well, I finished v0.1.1 of my first Chrome extension. Called Congresstributions (sort of a bastardization of Congress and Contributions if you didn't catch that), this extension adds a Congressperson's largest contributor after their name on any webpage. My next step is to make this prettier because I'm all about design, but right now I'm pretty happy with its primitive version for the time being. I'd highly suggest downloading it if you're into politics at all.</p>
    <p>COMPLETELY UNRELATED, I'm leaving to go on a road trip tonight with friends from high school, so there's a good chance I won't post anything for a week or so. After that I'll be interning with <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a>, so again, I probably won't be super present. But the week after I'll be home alone for a week (almost all universities go back a week earlier than mine), so I'll be up to no good working on projects then!</p>

    <p>So, he doesn't know I'm doing this, and I probably won't tell him, but I've read his posts and I think other people need to as well. There's this new "Buzzfeed-esque" blogging platform floating around called "Odyssey". I kind of hate it because it's all that shows up on my social media anymore, but I love reading some really insightful people's thoughts (and hate poorly written trash posts...so there's that). One of my favorite posts are by my good friend, Ryan Erickson. Ryan writes about a multitude of subject-areas and his articles always keep me entertained. So, if by some chance you're reading my blog and not his (which would be weird because I don't advertise mine or anything...), I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU READ HIS ARTICLES. I'm proud to call him my fraternity Brother!</p>

    <p>Quick little update here...since as long as I can remember my family has watched one movie <strong>EVERY</strong> Christmas: The Best Christmas Ever. This wonderful Wee-Sing movie has tons of catchy songs, elves that have names that are too similar to drugs, and so much 90s clothing that it makes me sick. I don't consider myself a very Christmas-y person&mdash;it's definitely not my favorite holiday (especially with all of the commercialization). However, this movie brings out all of the great parts and that little tap of nostalgia that makes me feel like a boy again. I would really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Christmas classic. It's bound to become one of your favorites!</p>

    <p>A year ago today I took my first picture with my Canon T5...an ambitious beginning to photography. The picture above is one of the first photos I took with my camera. Pictured is a neighborhood stray cat named "Tiddle" that my family allows to live in our garage (now our breezeway too!). I've learned a great deal in my one year as an amateur photographer. Photography is a great creative outlet, and I have actually made it constructive by earning a few awards in my county fair!

    <p>I thought this was a really cool data science project. In light of all of the Star Wars hype, here are all of the relationships between ALL characters analyzed in the first six movies. Evelina Gabasova did a great job. The creator first had to parse all of the scripts and get them into the correct format (which is ridiculously annoying), and then they used R to run statistical analysis and JavaScript to visually represent it. The end result is freaking cool and interesting to read about. I knew Obi-Wan was the best the whole time. I hope to do something like this in the future.</p>

    <p>I never needed anything to solidify the fact that I'm a nerd, but if I did this would be it.

As a programmer, you need to respect that balance." The life lessons from The Lion King seem to extend far beyond that of the actual movie.</p>

    <p>I feel this is better watched than explained. The first semester of my college experience I took a course with Brenda Boyle called "The Languages of War". This class was one of my favorites at Denison. We discussed war narratives and how patriotism is framed to call us to war and war is an act humans engage in simply to give ourselves meaning. The RIDICULOUS amounts of death that occurred in WWII should be avoided at all costs in the future. No issue should be so pressing to lose millions of lives in armed conflict. This video is humbling and thought-provoking.</p>
