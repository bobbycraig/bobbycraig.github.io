    <h3>One Year of Photography! <small>December 25, 2015</small></h3>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="images/Tiddle.jpg">
    <p>A year ago today I took my first picture with my Canon T5...an ambitious beginning to photography. The picture above is one of the first photos I took with my camera. Pictured is a neighborhood stray cat named "Tiddle" that my family allows to live in our garage (now our breezeway too!). I've learned a great deal in my one year as an amateur photographer. Photography is a great creative outlet, and I have actually made it constructive by earning a few awards in my county fair! I hope to continue on with my newest hobby for years to come&mdash;I'm not the best so it's great to see my progress as time goes on.</p>

    <h3>Deep Learning Car <small>December 22, 2015</small></h3>
    <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/GeorgeHotzCar.jpg"></a>
    <p>Really interesting perspective on how to get a self-driving car to work. Instead of teaching it how to drive, let it teach itself by watching you. While I'm not a fan of George Hotz's attitude, I think he's absolutely brilliant and this could be a great approach to a problem companies have been trying to tackle for a while.</p>

    <h3>Star Wars Social Networks <small>December 21, 2015</small></h3>
    <a href="http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/index.html"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/StarWarsNetworks1.png"></a>
    <p>I thought this was a really cool data science project. In light of all of the Star Wars hype, here are all of the relationships between ALL characters analyzed in the first six movies. Evelina Gabasova did a great job. The creator first had to parse all of the scripts and get them into the correct format (which is ridiculously annoying), and then they used R to run statistical analysis and JavaScript to visually represent it. The end result is freaking cool and interesting to read about. I knew Obi-Wan was the best the whole time. I hope to do something like this in the future.</p>

    <h3>Mufasa Explains C++ To Simba <small>December 19, 2015</small></h3>
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/recordsyourcomments/48-1"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/LionKingProgramming.jpg"></a>
    <p>I never needed anything to solidify the fact that I'm a nerd, but if I did this would be it. I found ridiculous amounts of joy in listening to Mufasa tell Simba about C++ as The Circle of Life majestically plays in the background. "All the code you write exists in a delicate balance. As a programmer, you need to respect that balance." The life lessons from The Lion King seem to extend far beyond that of the actual movie.</p>

    <h3>The Fallen of WWII <small>December 10, 2015</small></h3>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/128373915" class="thumbnail" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>I feel this is better watched than explained. The first semester of my college experience I took a course with Brenda Boyle called "The Languages of War". This class was one of my favorites at Denison. We discussed war narratives and how patriotism is framed to call us to war and war is an act humans engage in simply to give ourselves meaning. The RIDICULOUS amounts of death that occurred in WWII should be avoided at all costs in the future. No issue should be so pressing to lose millions of lives in armed conflict. This video is humbling and thought-provoking.</p>
