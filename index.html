Hi, so this is my homepage. It was built using a really nifty JQuery plugin. The idea here\n\
was to try to loosely emulate a terminal-style feel to this page but add personal flair and\n\
obviously some self-advertisement in. I'm not a web designer, although I do dabble from time\n\
to time. I just wanted to take this command to thank the people who designed JQuery Terminal\n\
Emulator for letting me use their plugin! Yay open source!\n");
