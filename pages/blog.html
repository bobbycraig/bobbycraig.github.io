          I’m currently trying to write a webapp. I’ve done a few projects before but nothing of the magnitude I’m planning for this one. That said, it’s really tough keeping all of my thoughts and decisions organized, and I’m looking for ways to do that best. While looking, I stumbled upon...

          I’ve not written on this blog in a long time. However, now exams are over and I’m back to espouse more wizzydum. I saw this article on Reddit and thought it was interesting…not necessarily a great article, but it combines two things I love––Harry Potter and web stuff. Read along...

          Several weeks ago, Denison’s computer science (and math) department decided to host an Hour of Code for any faculty, Granville residents, or students wanting to implement code into their repertoire of skills.

Today in my graph theory class, my professor brought up this interesting video. I don’t understand Topology at all…and it anything, this scares me! Furthermore, I’m not entirely sure how this relates to graph theory. Either way, it’s a cool thing to think about (and look at!).
